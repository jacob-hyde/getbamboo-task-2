- I have used Laravel conventions for the project structure.
- PSR-2 Standards
- DocBlocks I have heard are becoming more optional due to PHP now having type hinting. I have no issues using them, and
  did in this project to ensure understanding of functions and properties
- I could have added Feature tests, but felt that was out of scope

## Installation
- Clone the repository
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan test`
